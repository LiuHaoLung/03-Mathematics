    "The scalar has no dimensions, the geometry idea of a point, a point is obviously the simplest object in terms of geometry, it has no direction, nor size, so the scalar is like a point.\n",

    "The vector has one dimension, it is like a line, however it has a direction, it can be oriented in many ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to get from a line to a plane is by crossing it with another line, so two dimensional space is defined by two lines, well two lines means two vectors and in linear algebra a matrix is a collection of vectors, therefore any two dimensional plane can be represented by a matrix."
