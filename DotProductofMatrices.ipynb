    "Multiply a matrix with another matirx using the same concept the dot product, it can multiply two matrices, there is a compatibility measure too, it can only multiply a matrix of dimensions m by n with an n by k matrix, basically the second dimension of the first matirx has to match the first dimension of the second matrix, so it can multiply a 2 by 3 matirx with a 3 by 1 matrix, actually it can multiply it by a 3 by 2, 3 by 3, 3 by 4 and so on until the 3 by k matric, what's important is that those 3 are matching.\n",
